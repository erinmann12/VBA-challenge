# VBA-challenge

**Background**

For this project, I was tasked with analyzing a large, multipage file of stock data for three different years of stock market data.

**Tools Used**

1. Excel VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)
2. Microsoft Excel

**Project Tasks**

Using VBA scripting, I had to create a summary of the following: The ticker symbol, yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, the percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, and the total stock volume of the stock. 

 I used conditional formatting to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

The code is included in this repository, but the excel file was too large to upload. Instead, I've included screen shots of the first few rows of data on each page to show that the task was completed.
