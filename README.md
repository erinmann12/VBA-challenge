# VBA-challenge

For this project, I was tasked with looping through a large, multipage file of stock data for three different years.

Using VBA scripting, I had to create a summary of the following:
  -The ticker symbol
  -Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  -The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  -The total stock volume of the stock. 
  
 I also used conditional formatting to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
